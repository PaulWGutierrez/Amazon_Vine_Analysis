- #### How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?
  #### As seen on the image there are 334 Vine Reviews which are paid reviews, and 61,614 Non-Vine Reviews which are unpaid reviews.
  
- #### How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?  
  #### In the data in comparison to the large amount of reviews only 139 were 5 stars Vine programmed reviews and an immense amount of 5  stars Non-Vine reviews which counts to be 32,665 reviews.
  
- #### What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of Non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
  #### When it comes to the percentage in all between 5 stars Vine and Non-Vine program reviews calculates to be for the Vine program reviews about 41.62% and for the Non-Vine program reviews about 53.02%.

## Summary: 
#### When looking at the data it seems clear the big difference between paid and unpaid reviews. As far as the 5 star reviews from the Vine program we can say the 5 stars are not easily being handed out. From analyzing the data I believe there is no bias going on. One additional analysis I could do with the dataset is to filter in a date range of when reviews were made, that could have some affect.
